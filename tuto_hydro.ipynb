The calibration (or history-matching) is achieved by modifying the various model parameters so as to match the observed flow and water-level data.

    "-  Identifying the DRIAS2020 grid cells corresponding to the study area (e.g. the 8km square cells superimposing on the Selle watershed in Figure 1);\n",
    "- Calculating a spatial weighted average of the rainfall and PET at each time-step, in order to aggregate all the available time-series over the watershed. This weighted average is carried out according to the relative watershed area within the DRIAS2020  cell-size. Two aggregated rainfall and PET time-series are eventually obtained, that we will use in the model.\n",
